# E-MIPS
MIPS emulation library.

This crate contains implementations of MIPS processors and coprocessors. I made it for use in emulation projects.

It aims for:
- Modularity
- Performance
- Correctness ("correct enough")

### Features
- MIPS I ISA
- Modular Coprocessors

##### TODO:
- MIPS II, III, IV, 32, 64 ISAs
- Coprocessor 0 implementations
- Load delays, mul/div delays, full exceptions
